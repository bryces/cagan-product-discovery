# Cagan Product Discovery Skill

A comprehensive Claude skill for guiding product teams through Marty Cagan's product discovery and strategy frameworks.

## What This Is

This skill operationalizes Marty Cagan's discovery and strategy methodology (from INSPIRED, EMPOWERED, and TRANSFORMED) into a working guide for product teams. It helps teams:

- Validate problem hypotheses using Cagan's four product risks framework
- Plan and execute customer discovery research
- Synthesize findings into actionable insights
- Translate insights into OKRs and strategic bets

## Key Features

- **4-Stage Workflow:** Problem Validation → Discovery Planning → Discovery Execution → Synthesis → Strategy
- **Collaborative:** Emphasizes cross-functional discovery (PM, Designer, Engineer)
- **File Generation:** Creates both saved files (for version control) and artifacts (for editing)
- **Risk Assessment:** Uses Cagan's value/usability/viability/feasibility framework
- **Problem-Focused:** Discovers problems before solutions, avoids confirmation bias

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use in Claude Code

```bash
# Have the skill directory available, then in Claude Code:
```

```
I want to use the Cagan product discovery skill.

Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project
Problem hypothesis: [your hypothesis]
North Star: [your north star]
```

### Option 2: Add as Claude Project

1. Create a new Claude Project
2. Upload all files from this repository
3. Reference in project instructions

## Workflow Overview

### Stage 1: Problem Validation (1-2 weeks)
- Assess four product risks
- Create problem validation document
- Make go/no-go decision

### Stage 2: Discovery Planning (1 week)
- Design research approach
- Create interview guide
- Build recruiting strategy

### Stage 3: Discovery Execution (2-4 weeks)
- Conduct customer interviews
- Observe behaviors and workflows
- Document findings

### Stage 4: Discovery Synthesis (1-2 weeks)
- Extract patterns from raw data
- Create discovery readout
- Prepare for strategy definition

### Stage 5: Strategy Definition (1 week)
- Define OKRs
- Create strategic bets
- Plan handoff to delivery

## Key Principles

1. **Collaborative:** PM + Designer + Engineer discover together
2. **Assume Nothing:** Test every assumption
3. **Problem-First:** Discover problems before solutions
4. **Rapid Validation:** 2-4 weeks of discovery beats months of guessing
5. **Outcomes-Focused:** Measure what matters

## The Four Product Risks

Every problem hypothesis carries four types of risk:

1. **Value Risk:** Does the customer actually want this solved?
2. **Usability Risk:** Can we design something usable?
3. **Viability Risk:** Does this fit our business model?
4. **Feasibility Risk:** Can we technically build it?

Discovery tests these risks before engineering investment.

## How to Use REFERENCES.md

The `guides/REFERENCES.md` file maps Cagan's published work to the skill:

- **Books:** Specific chapters from INSPIRED, EMPOWERED, TRANSFORMED
- **SVPG Blog:** Posts organized by topic
- **Framework Mapping:** Which sources support which frameworks
- **Version History:** Track updates as you deepen engagement

As you read Cagan's work, update this document with new references and insights.

## Customization

This skill is a starting point, not a fixed process:

- **Adapt templates** for your product domain (B2B, SaaS, hardware, etc.)
- **Add examples** from your company
- **Adjust timeline** to your constraints
- **Create variations** for different team sizes/situations
- **Update REFERENCES.md** as you read Cagan

## Success Metrics

You'll know the skill is working when:

- Teams run discovery faster (validation + planning in <2 weeks)
- Less wasted engineering effort (problems validated before building)
- Better alignment (PM, Designer, Engineer understand problem the same way)
- Artifacts are actually used (discovery docs referenced during strategy/delivery)
- Better OKRs (based on customer understanding, not guessing)

## Resources

### Books
- **INSPIRED:** How to Create Products Customers Love
- **EMPOWERED:** Ordinary People, Extraordinary Products
- **TRANSFORMED:** Becoming a Modern Product Organization

### Online

- Blog posts on discovery, OKRs, strategy, team roles

## Contributing

If you enhance this skill:

1. Update the relevant framework documents
2. Add new templates if useful
3. Update REFERENCES.md with new sources
4. Document changes in version history
