# Quick Start: Using the Best Practice Empowered Product Team Skill

This skill guides cross-functional product teams through 6 discovery and strategy stages,
from opportunity assessment through presentation generation. It includes 11 templates,
persistent session tracking for multiple concurrent projects, and automatic file generation.

---

## Setup (One-Time)

### Step 1: Get the Skill Files

Clone or download the skill repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bryces/best-practice-empowered-product-team.git
cd best-practice-empowered-product-team/cagan-product-discovery
```

Note the full path to your local copy — you'll reference it when invoking the skill.

### Step 2: Choose Your Workspace

Decide where you'll use the skill:
- **Claude Code CLI** — Use in your terminal with Claude Code
- **Claude.ai Cowork (Projects)** — Use in the web app with persistent context
- **Team workspace** — Share with teammates via CLAUDE.md reference

---

## Usage by Environment

### Option A: Claude Code (Terminal)

When starting a new discovery project in Claude Code:

```text
I want to use the Best Practice Empowered Product Team skill.
SKILL.md path: /path/to/best-practice-empowered-product-team/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md

Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project
Problem hypothesis: [your hypothesis]
North Star: [success metric]

Help us validate and plan discovery.
```

Or resume an existing project:

```text
I want to resume my discovery work.
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md

What projects do I have in session?
```

The skill checks `.sessions-index.md` and shows your active projects.

### Option B: Claude.ai Cowork / Projects

For persistent, web-based access:

1. **Create a new project** in Claude.ai Cowork tab
   - Name: "Best Practice Empowered Product Team"
   - Description: "Cross-functional discovery using Cagan & Torres frameworks"

2. **Upload the skill files** to the project
   - Upload all directories: frameworks/, guides/, templates/, examples/
   - Upload SKILL.md and README.md

3. **Set project instructions** to reference the skill:
   ```markdown
   # Project Instructions
   
   This project uses the Best Practice Empowered Product Team skill for product discovery.
   When asked to help with discovery, reference SKILL.md for the workflow.
   ```

4. **Start conversations** in this project
   - Every conversation has the skill as context
   - Your session tracking files (`.sessions-index.md`) are preserved

### Option C: Team Workspace (CLAUDE.md Reference)

To make the skill available team-wide in a codebase or workspace:

**In your team repo, create or edit CLAUDE.md:**

```markdown
# Product Discovery

This team uses the Best Practice Empowered Product Team skill for validating
problems, running discovery, and defining strategy based on Cagan & Torres frameworks.

Skill location: /shared/path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md

When starting discovery: "I want to use the Best Practice Empowered Product Team skill"
```

Now any teammate can invoke the skill from this workspace without copying the path.

## Entry Points: Where Are You?

### 1. New Opportunity — Validate It First

**Starting point:** Pre-Stage 0 (Opportunity Assessment)

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md
Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project

Starting point: Pre-Stage 0 (Opportunity Assessment)

Opportunity: [describe the opportunity]
Target customer: [who would benefit]
Why now: [timing/context]

Should we commit resources to discovering this?
```

The skill scores the opportunity (5 dimensions: Strategic Fit, Market Potential,
Desirability, Viability, Feasibility) and gives GO / EXPLORE / HOLD / NO GO recommendation.

### 2. Problem Identified — Validate Before Discovery

**Starting point:** Stage 1 (Problem Validation)

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md
Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project

Starting point: Stage 1 (Problem Validation)

Problem hypothesis: [what problem exists]
North Star: [what success looks like]
Preliminary evidence: [any data you have]

Is this worth discovering?
```

The skill assesses the 4 product risks (Value, Usability, Viability, Feasibility)
and decides: GO to discovery or NO GO.

### 3. Problem Validated — Plan Discovery

**Starting point:** Stage 2 (Discovery Planning & Execution)

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md
Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project

Starting point: Stage 2 (Discovery Planning & Execution)

Problem: [one-line problem statement]
Timeline: [how long for discovery — 3 weeks typical]
Team: [PM name, Designer name, Engineer name]

Help us design our discovery approach.
```

The skill generates interview guides, research plans, and an optional Opportunity
Solution Tree to structure your solution exploration.

### 4. Have Interview Data — Synthesize It

**Starting point:** Stage 3 (Discovery Synthesis & Insights)

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md
Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project

Starting point: Stage 3 (Discovery Synthesis & Insights)

Interviews completed: [number]
Data format: [notes / transcripts / recordings]
Preliminary patterns: [any early themes]

Help us find patterns and write the discovery readout.
```

The skill helps synthesize raw data into patterns and creates an optional
Opportunity Solution Tree to map which solutions were validated/invalidated.

### 5. Discovery Done — Define Strategy

**Starting point:** Stage 4 (Strategy Definition)

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md
Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project

Starting point: Stage 4 (Strategy Definition)

Key findings: [top 3 patterns from discovery]
Problem changed?: [yes/no — how]
Go/No-Go: [do we still want to solve this]

Help us define OKRs and strategic bets.
```

The skill generates OKRs tied to findings, a strategic bet document, and a
delivery handoff summary for engineering.

### 6. Ready to Present — Generate Presentations

**Starting point:** Stage 5 (Presentation Generation)

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md
Project folder: /Users/me/projects/my-project

Starting point: Stage 5 (Presentation Generation)

Audience: [leadership / all-hands / board]

Help us create an executive summary and slide deck for stakeholders.
```

The skill generates two presentation files:
- `executive-summary.md` — Leadership-ready reference document
- `slide-deck.html` — 7-slide interactive presentation (print-to-PDF ready)

---

## Project Session Tracking

When you start discovery, a session file is created in `.sessions/[project-name].md`
tracking all 6 stages. The skill-level `.sessions-index.md` lists all your projects.

**Resuming after a break:**

```text
SKILL.md path: /path/to/cagan-product-discovery/SKILL.md

I want to resume discovery work.
What projects do I have in session?
```

The skill shows your active projects and lets you pick which to resume.

---

## What Gets Created

The skill auto-generates this folder structure:

```
/my-project/
├── discovery/
│   ├── 00-opportunity-assessment.md      ← Pre-Stage 0
│   ├── 01-problem-validation.md          ← Stage 1
│   ├── 02-discovery-plan.md              ← Stage 2
│   ├── 02b-opportunity-solution-tree-plan.md (optional)
│   └── 03-interview-guide.md
├── synthesis/
│   ├── 01-raw-insights.md                ← Stage 3
│   ├── 02-patterns-and-themes.md
│   ├── 03-discovery-readout.md
│   └── 04-opportunity-solution-tree-synthesis.md (optional)
├── strategy/
│   ├── 01-okr-definition.md              ← Stage 4
│   ├── 02-strategic-bet.md
│   └── 03-discovery-to-delivery-handoff.md
└── presentations/
    ├── executive-summary.md              ← Stage 5
    └── slide-deck.html

.sessions/
└── [project-name].md                     ← Session tracking
```

Each document is created as:
1. A saved `.md` file (for version control and sharing)
2. A Claude artifact (for viewing/editing in the tool)

---

## Sharing with Teammates

**Easiest:** Share the GitHub repository link.

```text
https://github.com/bryces/best-practice-empowered-product-team
```

They clone it, note their local path, and use the same invocation examples above.

**For teams:** Add the skill to your team's CLAUDE.md (see Option C above).

---

## Tips for Success

**Collaboration:** Have PM, Designer, and Engineer in discovery conversations.
The cross-functional perspective surfaces insights no single role would catch.

**Interview quality:** Design interviews to *discover*, not validate. Ask "how do
you solve this today?" not "would you buy our solution?"

**Session notes:** Leave detailed notes in your session file describing where
you stopped and what to do next. Future-you will be grateful.

**Customize templates:** The templates are starting points. Adapt them for your
industry, company, and team size.
